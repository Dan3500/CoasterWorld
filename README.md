# CoasterWorld

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.
Coaster World is a web site dedicated for roller coasters and fun parks of Spain. With this application, users can see a lot of information of the parks and their roller coasters in the same web site. The parks are PortAventura World, Parque Warner Madrid, Terra Mitica and Parque de atracciones de Madrid. Besides programming code of the application, it runs with a SQL Data Base, which contains the data of users, parks and roller coasters. This project was created as a big final project of my programming course (CFGS Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web). I wanted to upload the code in case it can help some junior or other programmers that need help with programming language or AJAX, and this project probably will be updated with different commits if I get new ideas.

# Internal structure

The application has front-end programmed in AngularJS 9 (TypeScript, JavaScript and CSS3) and back-end programmed in PHP 7. The communication of the front and back-end is made by using AJAX technology, and the data of the web site is stored in a SQL Data Base. The application is hosted by a xampp server in my PC (at this time, it's not hosted in a DNS Server), and was created with the development environment Visual Studio Code (for the programming code) and phpmyadmin (for modify and create the Data Base).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
